# Drift Race - 2 Player Browser Game
This is a 2D browser game for 2 players. In this game you will race against your friend with cars that are constantly drifting, and you will try to be the first to complete 3 laps. But if you feel like 3 laps is too little, or if you feel like the cars are too slow and too easy to control, there are Settings included in which you can change these things and many more!

## Settings
Negative values result in funny behavior, I could have disabled them, but I find them fun to play around with :) (Sometimes they break the game though.)

**Car Acceleration** – How fast do the cars accelerate.

**Car Rotation Speed** – How fast can the cars rotate (in degrees per step.)

**Laps To Win** – How many laps have to be completed by one of the players for the game to end.

**Air Friction (Drag)** – The friction of air, affects top speed of the cars and how quickly they stop after force is no longer applied. This also affects how much they drift.

**Wall Thickness** – How thick the walls of the track are.

**Car Size** – How big the cars are.
